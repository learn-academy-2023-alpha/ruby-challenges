# ‚ù§Ô∏è Challenges

# As a developer, I can create a hash called my_phone using the Ruby method .new.
my_phone = Hash.new 



# As a developer, I can add five key:value pairs of app names and their descriptions to my hash.

# Attempted some sort of iteration or mapping. There is almost certainly a way to do this. unknown now
# i = 0
# while i<app_names.length 
#     my_phone[app_names[i]] = app_descriptions[i]
#     i += 1

# p my_phone

# As a developer, I can return a value from my_phone by passing in the name of a key.
# p my_phone[:reddit]


# As a developer, I can update two keys in my_phone.
# my_phone[:app1] = my_phone.delete(:ford_pass)
# my_phone[:app2] = my_phone.delete(:discord)
# p my_phone


# As a developer, I can update two values in my_phone.
# my_phone[:ford_pass].downcase!
# my_phone[:reddit].downcase!

# p my_phone

# As a developer, I can delete two key:value pairs from my_phone.
# my_phone.delete :youtube
# my_phone.delete :reddit

# p my_phone

# As a developer, I can use an enumerable method to return information about all of my_phone's applications.

my_phone.each {|key, value| p "#{key} #{value}"} 


# üèî Stretch Goals

# As a developer, I can create a custom method that takes in my_phone and returns an array with the app name capitalized and information about each phone app.
# As a developer, I can create a custom method that takes in my_phone and returns an array with a sentence about the name of each app.
